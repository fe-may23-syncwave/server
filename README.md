## server

This is the server-side part of the project, using Express with TypeScript.

## How to work

- `npm install` - to install the required dependencies.
- `npm run dev` - to start server with auto-restart on code change.
- `npm start` - just starts the server.

## Project Structure

- `src/` - Directory containing the project's source code.
- `index.ts` - Main server file.
